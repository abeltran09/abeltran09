# Hi, I'm Angel Beltran!ðŸ‘‹ 
## ðŸŒŽ About Me
-ðŸŽ’ I am currently a student at Houston Christian University Majoring in computer science. This summer of 2024, I am a Data Engineer Intern at Sysco working with the Data Plaform Engineers on a Capstone Project. Last summer of 2023, I interned at Jebbit as a Software Engineer where I worked on the Platform team enhancing my skills in software development and platform management. From the years 2022-2024, I was in The Data Mine National Network at Purdue Univerisy where I got the chance to grow my skills in data analitics and data science.
-ðŸ‘€ I love to build Software Applications of all types and can work the full stack. I love working with data and I find myself having the most fun when I am building an application that is data heavy.
-ðŸŒ± Outside of tech I love to be active. I am into playing soccer, running, and mountain biking. I love nature and working to get into solo camping around the national parks in the US.
-ðŸ“• I love to read books about personal development.
